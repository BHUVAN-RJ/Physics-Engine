I built a 2D rigid body physics engine from scratch in C++ with real-time visualization using SFML. The engine supports particle dynamics, rigid body collisions with rotation, constraint systems, and multiple force generators. I implemented spatial partitioning for collision optimization and impulse-based collision response.
